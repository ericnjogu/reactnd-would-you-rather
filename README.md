# Would You Rather Project

This code is the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

In this web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. 
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. 

Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules


In this app, users are able 
* to answer questions, 
* see which questions they haven’t answered, 
* see how other people have voted, 
* post questions, and 
* see the ranking of users on the leader board
